Iury Gazinsky scored the first goal of Russia 2018 with a firmly-placed header, before substitute Denis Cheryshev - who replaced the injured Alan Dzagoev - scored the second before the break. Artem Dzyuba's goal came mere moments after being introduced before Cheryshev's stunner and Aleksandr Golovin's free kick sealed the victory.","If Stanislav Cherchesov had a dream about this game before it started, it could not have been more perfect. Gazinsky's early goal was a result of the pressure Russia applied. The hosts lost a creative influence in Dzagoev to an injury that could end up having big consequences later in the tournament, but his replacement scored an amazing goal after dribbling past three opponents. Dzyuba's uber-motivation was reflected by his swift impact, before Cheryshev and Golovin put the cherry atop the cake.","Saudi Arabia were made to pay for their defensive mistakes, and did not provide any attacking threat save for a brief forward foray by Mohammed Al Sahlawi in the first half.

Defender Jose Gimenez was the unlikely hero with a towering last-minute winning header, after Egypt had impressed with their organisation. Star forwards Edinson Cavani and Luis Suarez were largely starved of opportunities, although the former hit the post with a free-kick, as Uruguay finished strongly. Egypt's star forward Mohamed Salah failed to make an appearance after injury and the Pharaohs' Russia 2018 opener ended on a sour note.","Egypt's match against Uruguay was headed for a draw until Uruguay finally broke the deadlock. The Pharaohs held their opponents away from goal due to the defensive focus of coach Hector Cuper, which succeeded in reducing the danger of Edinson Cavani and Luis Suarez. However, the attack was not completely absent from the Egyptian team, despite the absence of Mo Salah.","Uruguay struggled to break down a well-organised Egypt side until the latter stages.

While it was Uruguay in the earlier encounter, a heartbreaking own goal sunk Morocco in IR Iran's favour for a 1-0 win.Morocco flew out of the traps in Saint Petersburg, carving out some sensational chances, but Iran easily could have gone in ahead at the break. By contrast, the second-half hardly had a opening worthy of note, until deep in stoppage time when Aziz Bouhaddouz headed into his own net.","Iran made it. A second ever win at a World Cup. Team Melli found itself still in the game come the closing stages after being under pressure in the opening minutes. They hit Morocco on the counter-attack at certain points, but to score the crucial goal they had to wait until the final seconds of stoppage time. That own goal leaves Iran hopeful and eager for their upcoming fixtures, but they still need at least a point to have a chance at qualifying.","A heartbreaking defeat for Morocco. They had the chances, but Amine Harit's superb supply only reflected the glaring absence of a true centre-forward in the team. In five visits now, Morocco have never won their first World Cup match.

300331524,Portugal,Spain,POR,ESP,First stage - Group B,Fisht Stadium,Sochi,2018-06-15 21:00:00,Ronaldo illuminates stellar draw with Spain," Cristiano Ronaldo was Portugal's saviour once again as he scored a hat-trick to secure a draw against Spain. It was the Real Madrid man's highest goal tally in a FIFA World Cup match. He kicked off with an early penalty, deceiving Nacho inside the box to win it and then stroking the ball home from the spot. Fortunately for *La Roja*, Diego Costa was also at his bristling best, getting the better of the Portugal defence to level the scores. Isco then thumped a rasping drive against the bar. Yet while Spain dominated possession they were vulnerable on the counter, and it was on the break that Ronaldo put his side back in front, firing in a drive that David de Gea was unable to hold.   Costa scored his second equaliser of the night just after the restart before Nacho atoned for his penalty-box trip on Ronaldo by powering a superb half-volley in off the post, his first goal for Spain. As the clock ticked down, however, Gerard Pique brought down CR7 just outside the box, with the Portugal star dusting himself down to complete the scoring with a sublime free-kick.  ","The Portuguese could not have wished for a better start, or a better ending for that matter. Spain made them work hard for a well-earned point, which came courtesy of a classy treble from the best player in the world.","Spain impressed on Fernando Hierro's debut in the dugout, coming from behind only for Cristiano Ronaldo to spoil De Gea's evening.

Although Les Bleus made a bright start, stars Kylian Mbappe, Paul Pogba and Antoine Griezmann were unable to capitalise on their chances. The Aussies gained a foothold in the game after the first 15 minutes, with Hugo Lloris palming their best first-half opportunity clear when team-mate Corentin Tolisso threatened to deflect a free-kick into his own net.The action then came thick and fast after the interval. After consulting with the video assistant referees (VAR team), referee Andres Cunha awarded France a penalty that Griezmann coolly converted. Samuel Umtiti then handled the ball in the box just a few minutes later, with Mile Jedinak scoring the resulting spot-kick. Didier Deschamps' side ultimately turned the match back in their favour, thanks to an own goal from Australia defender Aziz Behich.Both teams will be back in action on Thursday 21 June, when France take on Peru, while Australia will be under pressure against Denmark.","By the end of this match, only one thing was certain: France still have plenty of work to do. Their weaknesses were clear, as they sought to find their rhythm. It was a tough emcounter, and it is difficult to escape the fact that Les Bleus were very lucky to secure all three points in their opening game. Eleven top players do not always make a top team - not yet, anywayâ€¦","The Socceroos held their own against their French opponents. They may even have deserved a draw and can certainly be satisfied with their performance. They were well organised and resolute in defence.

Despite stamping their authority on the game's opening stages, La Albiceleste struggled to find space against a deep-lying Icelandic defence. The breakthrough came in the 19th minute when Sergio Aguero fired the ball home on the turn to give Argentina a 1-0 lead. The South Americans' joy was short-lived, however, as Alfred Finnbogason made history by scoring his country's first-ever World Cup goal just four minutes later.Lionel Messi had the biggest opportunity to take the lead in the second half, but his penalty was saved by Iceland goalkeeper Hannes Halldorsson. Although Argentina continued to press for a goal, they were repeatedly denied by the Nordic side's staunch defensive efforts.","While Argentina proved unable to find a win in their opening match, showed some defensive weaknesses and even missed a penalty, this match also provided plenty of encouragement. The team that took to the pitch were spirited with a clear game plan, despite failing to unlock an extremely compact Iceland defence.","Iceland's plan worked to perfection. The tournament newcomers know the kind of football they need to play to achieve their objectives. They have to be compact and unrelenting. The Icelandic players will not get results by playing Argentina's brand of attacking football.

The Peru fans were out in force in Saransk, making their players feel right at home. Suitably inspired, they dominated the first half but could not make the most of the opportunities they created.  Perhaps the pressure of Peru's 36-year absence from the world finals weighed heavy on their shoulders, with Christian Cueva missing a penalty just before the break. Playing a more patient game, the Danes were unable to generate any clear-cut chances as the first half ended goalless. Adopting a more adventurous approach after the restart, Denmark were rewarded when Christian Eriksen's precise through-ball allowed Poulsen to open the scoring. Though the South Americans piled the pressure on in search of an equaliser, the Danes held firm, with keeper Kasper Schmeichel pulling off some fine stops.  ","Brimming with confidence, Peru put in a performance that banished memories of their long absence from the world finals. The South Americans created numerous opportunities and missed a golden chance from the spot. Finding themselves a goal behind at the start of the second half, they turned to the talismanic Paolo Guerrero, but not even he could prevent them from falling to a defeat that did not reflect their efforts on the pitch.","Denmark came under a lot of pressure at the start of the match, not least on the right flank, and tried unsuccessfully to bring Eriksen into the game with a series of long balls.

The statistics at half-time during Croatia's meeting with Nigeria reflected an opening 45 minutes shaded by the Balkan side - but largely dominated by defenders. Ivan Perisic went closest to hitting the target with an effort from 20m after a quarter of an hour, but in the end it was Nigeria's Oghenekaro Etebo who brought joy to the huge Croatian contingent in Kaliningrad, beating his own goalkeeper following a corner.Cautious in the first half, Nigeria came out with more purpose after the break, only for Dejan Lovren and Domagoj Vida to keep Odion Ighalo well and truly quiet. In fact, just as the Super Eagles began turning up the pressure on Danijel Subasic's goal, the *Vatreni* (The Fiery Ones) responded by doubling their lead, Luka Modric converting from the spot after William Ekong held Mario Mandzukic in the box. It was no less than Modric deserved after a superb display that earned him the Budweiser Man of the Match award.","This was a difficult match for Croatia, but the Vatreni picked up three points in an excellent opening game for Zlatko Dalic's men. Perhaps they still need to find their rhythm, and perhaps they were not especially impressive, but ultimately they came out on top. There were gaps in the Nigerian defence and Croatia were able to make the most of them.","Nigeria had trouble creating chances, and unfortunate mistakes at set-pieces proved very costly against superior opposition. The Super Eagles lacked imagination up front, and although they were mostly able to frustrate Croatia's talented forwards at the back, it was not enough to secure three points.

In the second half, Serbia were more confident and scored the decisive goal. This game was about efficacy and accuracy and some players of Costa Rica did not have that this time. Their attackers were isolated throughout the second half and they did not create enough opportunities to score.

Juan Carlos Osorio's masterplan worked to perfection, with El Tri soaking up the long spells of German possession and hitting Die Nationalmannschaft on the counter-attack.

Not much worked as they had hoped for and changes will certainly be needed for Joachim Low in the next game.,Mexico came to the match with a plan and stuck to it to perfection.

Maintaining their intensity, they conjured up an equaliser just after the restart, with Steven Zuber nodding home from inside the six-yard box. The five-time world champions promptly lost their poise, and though they created some late chances, both their finishing and their play was slightly off key.","Brazil were unable to impose their style against very physical opponents.

The desire of Janne Andersson's charges was there for all to see as they emerged victorious over a disappointing Korea Republic.The Swedes were rewarded for an enterprising performance in which they created a series of goalscoring chances. As much due to their own profligacy as to the opposition backline, the hoards of Scandinavian fans in Nizhny Novgorod were made to wait until the second half before the deadlock was broken.The Taeguk Warriors conceded a penalty in the 65th minute following confirmation by VAR, and Swedish captain Andreas Granqvist shouldered the responsibility, coolly converting the resulting spot kick.Korea Republic pushed hard to find a way back into the game, but to no avail.

Though lacking imagination, Les Diables Rouges still created the clearest chances, with Panama captain Roman Torres working wonders to put a dangerous cross from Kevin De Bruyne out for a corner with 22 minutes gone.Frustrated and empty-handed at the break, Romelu Lukaku, Eden Hazard and Dries Mertens returned reinvigorated, not least the Napoli man, who had the Belgium fans cheering when he fired a sumptuous volley past Jaime Penedo just two minutes into the second half.

Immediately establishing a firm hold on their encounter, Gareth Southgate's team created a series of excellent chances before Harry Kane scored the opener, reacting quickest to a rebound and slotting home from close range.Nevertheless, the north Africans refused to lose heart after conceding or even when their goalkeeper Mouez Hassan was forced off through injury shortly afterwards. The Eagles of Carthage remained organised and disciplined, putting pressure on England all over the pitch and patiently waiting for an opening. Their opportunity finally came when Kyle Walker committed a foul in the English penalty area, allowing Ferjani Sassi to level from the spot.In the second half, Tunisia sat deep and hardly created any promising chances, but captain Kane stepped up to the plate, heading home his second of the match in additional time, again from close range, to save the day for the Three Lions.","Despite a difficult start to the first half and conceding early on, Tunisia did not give up and tried to get back into the game. England were clearly the dominant side and played better football, but the Tunisians managed to level up from the spot.

It evoked memories of their most recent World Cup campaign - their debut 16 years ago - in which they defeated holders France in Seoul in their opening match. The Poles are not quite as huge a scalp as Les Bleus, but the African side were underdogs nevertheless, and belied that status with their energetic performance. Idrissa Gueye's low drive was deflected into his own net by Thiago Cionek, but the Teranga Lions were good value for their lead. Mbaye Niang seized an opportunity in the hesitant Poland defence to round Wojciech Szczesny and double his side's advantage after the break.Grzegorz Krychowiak's decision-making was partly to blame for Senegal's second and he made some amends by reducing the arrears with a late goal. But it was ultimately in vain as Aliou Cisse's side held on to claim three points - their first World Cup win since Cisse captained the side to victory against Sweden in the Korea/Japan 2002 Round of 16.","The biggest worry for Poland before the game was whether their defence could keep out Senegal's attack without Kamil Glik, who is nursing a shoulder injury. Glik is called ""the boss of Polish defence"" and it proved impossible to find an adequate replacement for him today. Poland need to improve elsewhere too ahead of the clash against Colombia.","""We have talent that we want to show to the world,"" declared coach Aliou Cisse when his team landed in Russia.

However, the Iberians struggled to break down a reshuffled Iranian defence that included Majid Hosseini in place of the injured Roozbeh Cheshmi. Indeed, Spain's first clear opening did not arrive until around the half-hour mark, when David Silva went close with a sideways scissor kick, before narrowly missing the target again just before the break with a deflected shot.The second half started brightly and Gerard Pique, earning his 100th cap for Spain, had a chance from a corner before Sergio Busquets tried his luck from the edge of the penalty area. Team Melli had a sight of goal at the other end of the pitch in the 53rd minute, but Karim Ansarifard's shot could only brush the side netting. Spain took the lead with their next attack a minute later, the ball ricocheting into the net off Diego Costa, who registered his third goal in two matches.

With Lionel Messi lacking in inspiration, *La Albiceleste *paid for their defensive frailties on a dark night and are now on the verge of exiting the competition. The eastern Europeans were content to sit back in the first half, aware that Jorge Sampaoli's side had the greater need to attack. Though Argentina tried to take the initiative and enjoyed the lion's share of possession, they were unable to convert it into chances, with Sergio Aguero and a visibly ill-at-ease Messi largely anonymous. And when the South Americans finally carved out a clear-cut opportunity, Enzo Perez contrived to shoot wide with the goal gaping. Showing more ambition after the restart, the Croatians promptly revealed the shortcomings of their opponents' rearguard. A penetrating presence on the right, Ante Rebic capped a fine display by capitalising on a Willy Caballero error with a superb finish. Sampaoli turned to his bench for an immediate solution, and though Gonzalo Higuain, Paulo Dybala and Cristian Pavon all showed flashes of inspiration after coming on, there was to be no revival. Taking full advantage of Argentina's lack of composure at the back, Luka Modric and Ivan Rakitic both scored to compound their misery.   ",A nightmare!

The result means the race for second place in Group D will go down to the last game on 26 June. Ultimately, three teams will compete for a spot in the Round of 16 on the final day, with the Super Eagles still able to top the pool ahead of already-qualified Croatia.The hero of the match was undoubtedly Ahmed Musa, who came alive in the second half and played superbly, scoring both Nigerian goals. His first finish in particular will surely live long in the memory as one of the goals of the tournament: he controlled Victor Moses' cross with one touch, setting himself up for an unstoppable half-volley with his second. Both Musa's strikes were warmly received by the crowd at the Volgograd Arena, many of whom are familiar with the striker from his spells at CSKA Moscow.Interestingly, while the Super Eagles took control in the second half, in the first they failed to register a single shot on target on Hannes Halldorsson's goal. The Icelanders came close to narrowing the deficit towards the end of the match, but their main star Gylfi Sigurdsson spurned a glorious chance from the penalty spot.","Nigeria struggled to create clear-cut chances in the first half. After Ahmed Musa's two goals, Gernot Rohr's extremely young team gained a lot of confidence from their attacking efforts, however. This will help them for the crucial final game against Argentina on Tuesday. Nigeria have it in their own hands now to advance to the Round of 16. That's all they could have asked for.","After a good first half, Iceland seemed a little shell-shocked following the first goal they conceded.

Driven on by Dusan Tadic, who was in inspired form down the right flank, they strove to extend their lead. The Swiss hung in, patiently putting moves together but without genuinely threatening. Blerim Dzemaili had their best chance half an hour in, forcing Serbia keeper Vladimir Stojkovic to push the ball clear.Rejuvenated after the break, the Swiss took just seven minutes to pull level, thanks to Granit Xhaka's sublime drive from outside the box. The angle of post and bar then denied Xherdan Shaqiri, though the diminutive Swiss forward would have the last laugh. Sprinting clear of the Serbian defence as injury time approached, Shaqiri planted the ball beneath the advancing Stojkovic to move his side into second place in the pool.","It was an assignment that was every bit as tough as Serbia expected. While Mladen Krstajic's side are unlikely ever to be outmuscled, they are not one of the quicker sides in the competition, a shortcoming that ultimately cost them the match. The Swiss exploited their lack of pace to perfection, not least the darting Shaqiri. There was, nevertheless, plenty for Serbia to be pleased about, with Mitrovic particularly impressive in the air. His performance will be just one of the reasons why they will go into their final group match against Brazil with hope.","The 2-1 win took a long time to materialise and was only secured in the closing stages, when Shaqiri pounced.

Having already threatened, Ola Toivonen found a way past the imposing Manuel Neuer with a fantastic lob just after the half-hour mark.Low rallied his troops and sent on Mario Gomez at half-time to bolster the German front line, but it was the irrepressible Marco Reus who conjured up an equaliser, the ball bouncing in off his knee. Despite enjoying the lion's share of possession, Germany continued to squander chances, with Gomez missing the most clear-cut opportunity.Jerome Boateng's sending-off for a second yellow card in the 82nd minute hardly improved matters for Germany, nor did Olsen's stunning reflex saves or a Julian Brandt shot that came back off the post. However, the Blagult No1 could do nothing about Kroos' stoppage-time winner, which flew past him like a rocket and put an end to his team's hopes of taking something from the game.","A winning goal in injury time while playing with ten men: this was Germany at their most impressive. You had a feeling that it might not be their tournament when Boateng was dismissed and Brandt hit the post, but Kroos has put the team's destiny right back in its own hands.","This could have been a dream result for Sweden, whose plan was clear from the outset: defend, hit Germany on the counter-attack and try to pick up a result. And it all worked perfectly until that final strike.

Only top spot in Group G will be on the line when the Three Lions and Red Devils do battle next time out.Gareth Southgate's team once again showcased their dead-ball prowess: two of their goals were penalties and a further two were headers from a corner and free-kick respectively. As for the Panamanians, they knew in advance that they would have to be clinical to stand any chance of getting something out of the game. Instead, they spurned the first two opportunities of the match and then promptly capitulated, finding themselves 2-0 down shortly after.John Stones headed home a brace, while Harry Kane hit the tournament's second hat-trick so far, twice converting convincingly from the spot and then completing his treble when a Ruben Loftus-Cheek shot flicked off him and be diverted into the net.Despite taking a pummelling, Panama also had grounds to celebrate when they scored their first-ever World Cup goal courtesy of a fine finish from 12 yards from Felipe Baloy.","After just two matches at Russia 2018, England have already broken records. The Three Lions had never scored more than four goals in a World Cup match before, but had already helped themselves to five before the break against Panama. Moreover, following his double against Tunisia, Harry Kane's hat-trick moved him top of the tournament's scoring charts. It was a great all-round performance that set pulses racing among the England supporters, who will be heartened to see the goals being spread around the team.","Panama's World Cup dream went somewhat sour in this second match. Following a lively start, the team were guilty of putting the game on a plate for England with their defensive errors.

The result keeps the pair at the group summit after each had won their respective opening outings.Senegal started with real attacking intent and they were rewarded as star forward Sadio Mane took full advantage of some defensive hesitancy to score after 11 minutes. Despite enjoying more possession, Japan remained on the back foot until Takashi Inui netted just past the half-hour, with a smart curling finish from inside the penalty area.Yuya Osako missed a golden opportunity on the hour mark, and Inui hit the crossbar minutes later as Japan's attacking outlets found space. Senegal made Japan pay for their profligacy as 19-year-old Moussa Wague lashed home on 71 minutes, but substitute Keisuke Honda equalised seven minutes later, finishing off Inui's cut-back pass from close range.","This draw was earned on the back of some veterans such as second goal-getter Keisuke Honda, and skipper Makoto Hasebe who controlled at the back confidently. Takashi Inui's fantastic attacking performance was also a highlight. Without his first goal and assist for Honda this could have been a very different game.",Once again the lack of concentration was one of the negative aspects from this game for Senegal. They created several beautiful attacking sequences but there was some porous defending on the other side. Senegal will be looking to remain focussed throughout the full 90 minutes of their concluding group match.

The tension was palpable, with both sides starting tentatively and neither wanting to fall behind in front of a sell-out crowd of 42,837 at the Kazan Arena. The first real chance came in the 40th minute, when the consistently lively James Rodriguez crossed the ball into the penalty area for Yerry Mina to nod home.The BiaÅ‚o-czerwoni were forced to throw caution to the wind in the second half, creating counterattacking space for their South American opponents in the process. The best opportunity for an equaliser fell to Robert Lewandowski, but his close-range effort was denied by the onrushing David Ospina. In the 70th minute Juan Quintero played a dream pass to Falcao, who stroked the ball past Wojciech Szczesny with the outside of his boot to double Colombia's advantage. Juan Cuadrado made it 3-0 just a few minutes later to put the result beyond doubt, courtesy of another assist from James.","Another game, another disappointing result for Poland. Although Adam Nawalka's side played as aggressively as they did against Senegal, it was not enough. The absence of defensive linchpin Kamil Glik through injury has had a major impact on the team. The White and Reds also lacked options up front, with Robert Lewandowski frequently finding himself isolated. Just like in 2002 and 2006, where they also failed to win their opening matches, Poland were once again unable to qualify for the Round of 16 here in Russia.","Having ridden out an intense first half, Colombia were able to play on the break after taking the lead, with their pacy wingers repeatedly venturing forward to create new goalscoring opportunities.

La Celeste's lead was then doubled when Cheryshev scored the sixth own goal at Russia 2018, equalling the record for a single World Cup (1998), after Diego Laxalt's shot took a heavy deflection.Things went from bad to worse for the hosts when defender Igor Smolnikov was given his marching orders in the 36th minute after receiving two yellow cards.Attacking changes at the break from Russia head coach Stanislav Cherchesov brought goalscoring opportunities but they could not breach 100-cap Fernando Muslera's goal. Cavani had the final say of the evening when he pounced on an Akinfeev parry following captain Diego Godin's header. Cavani equalled team-mate Suarez's record by scoring at three different World Cups (2010, 2014 and 2018).","This was definitely Uruguay's most complete match of Russia 2018. They brought intensity to play, generated good goalscoring chances, were solid in defence and scored two goals to bring a calmness to the team. In the second half, things changed and the match was more even as Uruguay allowed Russia more time on the ball. The most important thing is that the result is very positive, Uruguay showed a different side to their previous performances and qualified in the first position of Group A.",Russia had to face a different level of opponent this time; an opponent with skill and experience at major tournaments. Everything went wrong for the host team. Uruguay punished their very first mistake but there was more. Luck was also not on Russia's side when a deflection off Cheryshev's leg led to another goal.

The match between Group A's two already-eliminated sides had everything: fight, emotion, goals, broken records and a dramatic twist at the end.Mohamed Salah's neatly-taken lob over the onrushing goalkeeper looked to have knocked the wind out of the Saudi sails, and they almost conceded a second to the Liverpool forward immediately afterwards. However, Juan Antonio Pizzi's team refused to give in and instead scored twice themselves - once at the end of each half.But not before a unique piece of World Cup history: legendary Pharaohs shot-stopper Essam Elhadary, who at 45 years and 161 days is now the oldest player ever to feature at the tournament, superbly thwarted one penalty kick only to be beaten by Salman Alfaraj from 12 yards moments later. Salem Aldawsari rolled home a volley to snatch victory with the game's final influential touch.","Saudi Arabia played their best match of the tournament, showing quality football virtually throughout the entire 90 minutes. A momentary lapse in concentration led to the conceded goal, but the players quickly gathered themselves together and equalised before half-time. In the second half, the Saudis were the more technically proficient side and managed to snatch victory at the end. ","The Egyptians were faced with one clear task in this match: to get their first win in FIFA World Cup history.

Though already eliminated, Morocco had an objective of their own: to ensure they did not leave the competition goalless. Morocco were the first to fulfil their aim, as forward Khalid Boutaib capitalised on a misunderstanding between Sergio Ramos and Andres Iniesta to sprint clear and slip the ball under David De Gea with 14 minutes on the clock. Clearly stung, *La Roja* took just five minutes to reply, with Iniesta slipping the perfect pass to Isco, who fired home from close range. That was not the cue for the Spanish machine to click into gear, however, as the Atlas Lions continued to make life difficult for them. Boutaib scampered clear once more only to be denied by De Gea, and though Diego Costa was inches away from converting another pinpoint Iniesta pass before the break, the Moroccans went close yet again when Nourredine Amrabat struck the angle of post and bar with a fizzing drive ten minutes into the second half.  Spain's response to that scare was to keep the ball and bump up their possession stats, though it was the Africans who struck next when Youssef En Nesyri powered home a header from a corner with nine minutes remaining. But just when Morocco though the points were theirs, Iago Aspas scored with a fine back-heeled flick in stoppage time as Spain ultimately made first place theirs.  ","In their final group match Spain had to settle for a share of the points, secured in dramatic fashion by Aspas' injury-time strike. The Spanish had earlier passed up several chances to take the lead in a match lit up by some sparkling interplay between Isco and Iniesta. Defensive errors ultimately cost La Roja the win but not top spot in the section. "," Morocco departed on a high. Already eliminated on their fifth World Cup appearance, the north Africans restored their pride in style by holding the 2010 world champions in check thanks to goals from Boutaib and En Nesyri, who plays his club football for Malaga. Though Spain pressed high at the start of the match, Herve Renard's side - captained by Mbarek Boussoufa - did not give an inch.

Already eliminated, Los Incas set about their task with calmness and patience before breaking the deadlock with their first chance on 18 minutes, Andre Carrillo volleying a splendid effort inside the far post from a cross. It was a wonderful finish and a memorable moment, sparking joy among the sea of Peru supporters decked out in red.For Australia, that early goal was a damaging blow to their hopes of clinching a spot in the last 16. The Socceroos needed a victory combined with a France win against Denmark to advance, but the situation in the other game began to matter far less after Paolo Guerrero doubled the deficit five minutes after the break, adding to his assist for the opener.Although Tim Cahill came on for his first taste of action in three games, Australia remained short of ideas. Instead, Peru maintained their dominance to soften the blow of their early exit, the South Americans putting in another impressive performance - and this time ending with the goals to show for it.","It may be something of a clichÃ©, but Australia can travel home from this World Cup with their heads held high. Their elimination will be heartbreaking for their fans, who had hoped for better things following some positive displays in Russia - including against Peru, whom they pressed hard without success. All that remains is the memory of seeing veteran forward Tim Cahill and youngster Daniel Arzani on the same pitch for the first and surely final time.","With the pressure off, Peru played with more freedom and intelligence than in their first two matches.

Christian Eriksen went closest for the Danes on two occasions, either side of the interval.

A raucous and partisan crowd roared on the South Americans, with Messi's superb thigh control and finish providing a huge emotional release after a frustrating tournament.Denied a second when Francis Uzoho tipped his free-kick onto the post, Argentina looked to be drifting out of the competition, only for Rojo to score the winner against the Super Eagles for the second finals running.

Overrun by the Croatians in the early stages, they began to push forward on learning that Argentina had taken the lead in their game, creating four good chances in the closing ten minutes of the first half.

However, neither team seriously threatened to score and the only dangerous chance was from a swerving Koo Jacheol free-kick that caused Manuel Neuer some difficulty, but the goalkeeper managed to block it and then flick the ball away just in time before Son Heungmin could get to the rebound.Die Nationalmannschaft had a glorious opportunity to break the deadlock at the start of the second period but Leon Goretzka's header was brilliantly saved by Jo Hyeonwoo. Timo Werner went close shortly after that following excellent interplay between Mesut Ozil and Marco Reus, as Germany started to push forward with greater purpose.

Though Los Ticos were already out of the competition, they at least had the consolation of scoring their first goals of the competition and collecting their first points.The Central Americans made an enterprising start as they sought to atone for their two earlier defeats. Determined not to leave Russia as the only goalless side in the tournament, they struck the woodwork twice in the opening ten minutes.As in their two previous games, the Swiss were slow out of the blocks, but eventually managed to stem the Tico tide before taking the lead on 31 minutes, with Stephan Lichtsteiner crossing into the box and Blerim Dzemaili lashing home a loose ball.Die Nati struggled for inspiration after the break, their midfield short on ideas and their incursions into the opposition box proving all too rare. Finding themselves still in the game, Costa Rica levelled through a fine Kendall Waston header. Though the Swiss regained the lead late on, the Costa Ricans levelled in stoppage time, when a Bryan Ruiz penalty cannoned off the bar, onto to keeper Yann Sommer's head, and into the back of the net.","Though a draw was not a bad result for the Swiss, the performance left something to be desired, as Vladimir Petkovic's side failed to click. Lacking in ideas at the start of the game and seemingly unsure of themselves, they then struggled to recover from Costa Rica's first equaliser.

It is the third time the East Asians have made it past the group stage at a World Cup finals, having achieved the feat in back in 2002 and 2010.Akira Nishino made six changes to the line-up that started against Colombia and Senegal, and it would be fair to say the large-scale rotation did his team no favours. The Japanese lacked a cutting edge in attack, and it was Poland who created the two best chances of the game. Shortly before the interval, Eiji Kawashina was forced into a spectacular diving save to claw Kamil Grosicki's header off the goalline, but the goalkeeper could do nothing about Jan Bednarek's short-range volleyed finish in the second half.For the Poles, who even before the start of today's match knew they were on their way home, it was their first win in the competition.","A draw was enough for Japan to qualify for the Russia 2018 knockout phase, but the changes to the starting XI and the new tactical approach did not help the team. The Japanese only advance to the Round of 16, thanks to Colombia's win over Senegal and having picked up fewer yellow cards than the Africans. A win, a draw and a loss ultimately turned out to be sufficient for the Samurai Blue.","Poland already had zero chances of making it to the knockout rounds, but victory in their last match of the group stage does redeem the national team somewhat in the eyes of their fans.

As a result, there was unsurprisingly a disjointed and somewhat subdued feel to the game right from the off, with many players struggling to find their bearings.That is not to say there were no chances. The Belgians were the first to threaten. Jordan Pickford denied Mousa Dembele early on before keeping out Marouane Fellaini. Trent Alexander-Arnold then saw his cross-shot whistle narrowly past the post on the half-hour mark and Ruben Loftus-Cheek failed to find the target with a header four minutes later. However, that was about as good as it got in the first half, leaving the crowd at the Kaliningrad Stadium craving more action after the break.Soon enough, Adnan Januzaj ensured that the fans would go home having got their money's worth. With just six minutes on the clock in the second period, the Belgium attacking midfielder dropped a shoulder, skipped past Danny Rose and curled a sumptuous left-footed strike into the top corner. To their credit, the Three Lions did not lie down after going behind. Phil Jones had an opportunity to equalise after an hour and Marcus Rashford twice went close, but Belgium held on to secure their third win in as many matches at Russia 2018 and clinch top spot in the group.","_This game had two intended illustrations for Gareth Southgate, firstly offering him a chance to see players who were yet to start a World Cup game under his watch, and revealing their last-16 opposition. While his side, with its eight changes, stumbled through a fairly uneventful first half, they edged Belgium on possession and both Danny Rose and Trent Alexander-Arnold gave encouraging performances, while the team stuck to the system and looked ready to prey on set-pieces. Adnan Januzaj's beautifully curled finish brought out a more competitive streak in the Three Lions, however, as those players competing for starting positions battled to prove a point to the dugout.","Roberto Martinez had thrown down the gauntlet to the incoming understudies, challenging them to seize their chance and stake their claim to dislodge the regular starters. While he can be pleased with a symbolic victory over big-name opposition, the coach will not be prompted into rethinking his plans in the Round of 16.

A few minutes later Mbappe was again brought down, this time in the penalty area, and Greizmann made no mistake from the spot. Argentina needed a spell of possession to compose themselves and digest going behind. They also needed something special to get back into the game, and Angel Di Maria provided it with a stunning long-range strike to bring them level, against the run of play, before the interval.Buoyed by that equaliser, the South Americans turned the game on its head in the second period. Lionel Messi collected the ball after a free-kick was only half-cleared, and his shot on the turn was diverted into the net by Gabriel Mercado. Les Bleus did not need to wait long to provide the perfect response to going behind, however. Benjamin Pavard scored a wonder goal of his own to make it 2-2, before the irrepressible Mbappe scored twice in four minutes. Argentina replied yet again late on through substitute Sergio Aguero, but it was too little, too late for the South Americans.","The French team showed themselves and the world what they are capable of.

The European champions huffed and puffed but could not blow down the Uruguayan house, searching in vain for a moment of magic from Cristiano Ronaldo, who passed up a presentable chance from a dangerously positioned free-kick.It was from another sort of dead-ball delivery that Portugal found a chink in the armour, Pepe equalising with a header from a corner after the break. However, the veteran centre-back's joy was short-lived, as Cavani restored the South Americans' lead with a stunning side-footed finish not long afterwards.The Uruguayans will have to be just as solid at the back if they are to emerge victorious from their quarter-final tie against France, who were scintillating going forward during their win over Argentina earlier in the day. The stage is set for a cracker in Nizhny Novgorod on 6 July.","It was not Uruguay's finest performance, but the result is what counts for La Celeste.

Koke saw his effort saved by Igor Akinfeev, before Iago Aspas's unsuccessful spot kick sent the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow into delirium.It had all started so well for La Roja - who silenced the Luzhniki in the opening moments - a set-piece providing the opportunity for Spain to take the lead. Sergio Ramos proved a nuisance to Sergei Ignashevich, and the veteran defender turned the ball into his own net.But Russia did not wilt in the sticky Moscow evening. The imperious Artem Dzyuba revelled in his battle with Ramos and Gerard Pique, and another one of his victorious skirmishes against the latter resulted in the Barcelona man handling inside the box. Dzyuba himself stepped up and sent David De Gea the wrong way.The second half settled into a pattern of Spanish possession and Russian counter-attacks, but beside a late save by Akinfeev from Andres Iniesta, neither side looked ready to win the game in normal time. A brave defensive performance from Russia in extra time earned them a penalty shootout against the 2010 winners, where Akinfeev was ultimately the hero.","Spain deserved more from the 120 minutes. They controlled the game from the start but hard work by the Russian defenders made their job incredibly difficult. Despite the good first half for La Roja with the own goal, the penalty changed things. Andres Iniesta's introduction also altered the pattern of play, with Spain looking more confident after his entrance. De Gea could not keep out the Russians, while Koke and Aspas were unsuccessful from the spot.","Russia brought the plan for this game to life with patience and determination even though it had all started as a nightmare with an own goal by Sergei Ignashevich under pressure from Sergio Ramos.

The Scandinavians' joy lasted just three minutes. Presented with Croatia's first chance, Mario Mandzukic tucked home a loose ball to restore parity.Croatia became more dominant as the half wore on, with Luka Modric directing traffic from a more withdrawn position than in other games. Denmark had their chances, however, with Christian Eriksen clipping the crossbar.The Scandinavians grew in belief as the minutes passed, but let themselves down with some wayward finishing. Short on energy, the Vatreni were unable to find the back of the net themselves, and the match ticked into extra time. Croatia tried to force the pace late on, and passed up a golden chance to win it when Kasper Schmeichel denied Modric from the spot with four minutes remaining. The Danes waited for the shootout, confident in Schmeichel's penalty-saving expertise. The keeper stopped two, but Subasic went one better to take his side through.","Zlatko Dalic predicted a tough test for his side and that is exactly how it turned out.

He slid in to finish from close range after Willian sent in a dangerous, low cross on 51 minutes. Brazil continued to create scoring chances and, with full-time closing in fast, Firmino tapped in at the back post as Neymar turning provider to seal victory.","Mexico were much more aggressive in the first 15 minutes of the match, but Brazil were prepared for that.

Tite's team are proving they can be solid at both ends.","Mexico fought bravely against Brazil, but in the end they deservedly lost against a better team. El Tri played a risky strategy in the first half, pressuring the South Americans very aggressively and making them suffer every time they had the ball. The idea was to score quickly and then manage the rhythm of the game. But that didn't happen and the team tired.

The manner of the win will surely fill the side with confidence as they now advance to the quarter-finals of the 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia where they will face none other than Brazil.Following a tight first half in which both defences had the upper hand, barring the odd minor lapse in concentration, Japan took a commanding lead with two goals at the start of the second half. Genki Haraguchi put the Blues ahead with an angled finish in the 48th minute, before Takashi Inui fired in a wonderful long-range strike for his second goal of the tournament.Nobody doubted the ability of Roberto Martinez's side, but here was a true test of their resolve. After a frantic few minutes, the manager opted for a change in approach with the introduction of the 6'4"" danger man Marouane Fellaini, and the tactical shift paid dividends. In the 69th minute, Jan Vertonghen's looping header threw Les Diables Rouges a lifeline, before Fellaini himself headed home the equaliser five minutes later.As the game progressed, extra time seemed an inevitability. Yet Nacer Chadli had other ideas, the substitute applying the finishing touch to a textbook counter-attack in the fourth minute of stoppage time to send the Belgium fans into delirium.","Until Vertonghen's goal, Belgium had failed to demonstrate the mental resilience demanded by this sort of match at a World Cup. But from that moment on, with the Japanese perhaps paying dearly for their earlier exertions, the Belgians upped their game. The team went through a rollercoaster of emotions, right up until the wonderful counter-attack that paved the way to victory. And then came relief.","It's a very disappointing result for Japan, having gone two goals up. Everything seemed to be under control, but an error by goalkeeper Kawashima led to the first goal.

As such, Switzerland were the more active influence in the game when it came to possession, but the reactive approach from Janne Andersson's side proved the more fertile. Chances were limited, but the better of them fell at Swedish feet.In something of a war of attrition, as time progressed glimpses of a potential pivotal moment began to shine through, with only poor finishing and good fortune snuffing them out. However, it was fortune that eventually brought about the winner.Forsberg was given far too much space at the edge of the box and - having failed to live up to his pre-tournament billing as Sweden's star attraction - saw his effort deflect wildly off Manuel Akanji into the top corner, sending them into the last eight.","The dream continues for Sweden. It wasn't the most confident of wins but they got the job done as Forsberg quietened his recent critics. Gustav Svensson did an impressive job replacing one of the team's key players in the suspended Sebastian Larsson, but a big blow for the Swedes was seeing one of their giants in defence, Mikael Lustig, leaving the pitch injured. But, all in all, being in a quarter-final is an achievement the team can be very proud of.","Switzerland were not worse today than they have been, but they needed to take the game to Sweden. Again and again they found themselves under pressure from counter-attacks. Above all, they never got Forsberg under control - and that proved pivotal. Switzerland has failed to make history against a beatable opponent, with their last memories of a quarter-final remaining from 1954.",1,0,12,18,3,4,6,5,3,9,0,0,3,11,1,0,37,63,73,84,271,599,199,501,105,103,47,27,3,2,9,3,33,15,1,2,0,1,0,0,11,13,Skomina Damir,SVN,partly cloudy,18,10,60

Penalties were needed at Moscow's Spartak Stadium to decide the match and keep alive the Three Lions' dream of a second World Cup title after 1966.After a frenetic opening, England began to dictate the tempo of the game. Harry Kane, Raheem Sterling and Jesse Lingard kept moving well between the lines and were rewarded with several set piece opportunities. Without injured superstar James Rodriguez, Colombia relied on quick counterattacks but rarely posed a threat in front of the opposition's goal.The second half got off to the perfect start for England. After being brought down in the penalty area, captain Kane converted the resulting spot-kick to give his team the lead. Undeterred, Colombia threw everything forward in the final quarter of an hour and snatched an equaliser through Yerry Mina in the 93rd minute.Although both teams pushed for a winner in extra time, penalties were ultimately needed to determine the outcome. After Jordan Henderson's shot was saved for England and Mateus Uribe and Carlos Bacca both failed to score for Colombia, Dier's successful spot-kick sealed the Three Lions' place in the last eight."," Colombia showed character, determination and mental strength at this World Cup. After losing to Japan in their opening game, the team recorded vital wins against Poland and Senegal to top the group. They are an ambitious side who refused to give up after falling behind to England. Despite forcing the match to extra time and then penalties, they were unable to book a place in the quarter-finals."," From Jordan Pickford, who made a name for himself, to Eric Dier, who scored the decisive penalty, no member of Gareth Southgate's team will ever forget this night. The coach can be proud of his players, who implemented their game plan and showed an irrepressible will to win. England will return to their base in Repino to work on closing out matches, but for now they can enjoy their first victory in a knockout game for 12 years.",1,1,14,16,4,2,7,9,3,5,0,0,2,7,1,2,49,51,78,82,516,571,405,471,136,143,59,59,17,6,5,3,39,27,6,2,0,0,0,0,23,13,Geiger Mark,USA,cloudy,18,7,61
300331543,Uruguay,France,URU,FRA,Quarter-finals,Nizhny Novgorod Stadium,Nizhny Novgorod,2018-07-06 17:00:00,Clinical Bleus end Uruguayâ€™s dream,"France won through to the World Cup semi-finals for the first time in 12 years after seeing off a combative Uruguay side that struggled in the absence of the injured Edinson Cavani. Los CharrÃºas made a strong start all the same, with Cavani's replacement Cristhian Stuani shooting across the face of goal. At the back, meanwhile, La Celeste were their usual organised selves, giving away no space whatsoever.Seeing more of the ball, France put some good moves together only to struggle in the box, where the Uruguayans were quick to snuff out any danger. Ironically, France's opener came from a set-piece, habitually one of La Celeste's strengths, with Raphael Varane glancing a header home from Antoine Griezmann's pinpoint delivery. The Uruguayans would have equalised on the stroke of half-time but for a miraculous stop from Hugo Lloris, who dived full-length to claw away a Martin Caceres header.In a bid to turn the game around, Uruguay coach Oscar Tabarez rang the changes in the second half, sending on Maxi Lopez and Cristian Rodriguez. Their Russia 2018 hopes came to an end, however, when a Griezmann shot deceived Fernando Muslera and slipped through the keeper's hands and over the line.","Having enjoyed a relatively stress-free campaign so far, Uruguay were made to suffer against France. Though Les Blues dominated play, La Celeste still managed to create openings, but could find no way past Lloris, who was on top form. Tabarez reshuffled his midfield in the second half but was unable to alter the course of the game. Though not at their best on a frustrating afternoon, Uruguay can take pride from their campaign.","In terms of intensity, this was a match that lived up to expectations, generating plenty of tension from start to finish. In the end, it all came down to two pairs of hands. While Lloris' saved France, Muslera's sealed Uruguay's defeat. France gave nothing away in defence, denying the Uruguayans space as they battled in vain to get back into the match.",0,2,11,11,4,2,6,7,1,2,0,0,4,3,0,0,42,58,67,81,322,524,215,427,103,99,45,48,14,7,2,1,21,51,2,2,0,0,0,0,17,15,Pitana Nestor,ARG,partly cloudy,22,13,53

The Belgians were ahead against the run of play after Fernandinho, replacing the suspended Casemiro, deviated a flicked-on corner into his own net.There was nothing fortunate about the European side's second. Reminiscent of their on-the-break winner against Japan, Kevin De Bruyne polished off a flawless attack move with a sumptuously struck finish.The South Americans tried to pile the pressure on their opponents again after half-time but a combination of the excellent Thibaut Courtois and feverish defending proved too much to break down. As the spurned chances stacked up, it was left to substitute Renato Augusto to head home a Coutinho cross to hand Brazil hope.Belgium refused to fold, however, in the enthralling closing stages, ensuring Roberto Martinez's side reached the World Cup semi-finals for only the second time in their history.","While Belgium took the lead with a combination of fortune and their attacking skill, the Brazilians were calmer in possession after half-time, played their game and stifled the Belgians. Nevertheless, A SeleÃ§Ã£o were simply not clinical enough in front of goal to convert their chances - and were not helped by a superb performance from Courtois.","It seemed written in the stars that Belgium would win. Everything simply fell into place as Courtois showed just how good a goalkeeper he is, while the Red Devils enjoyed crucial bits of luck in key moments. What's more, nothing seemed to go Neymar's way, as Brazil looked uncharacteristically uncertain in front of goal. The pain of Belgium's defeat by the same opponents in the Round of 16 at the 2002 World Cup enhances the joy of reaching the semi-finals in Russia that little bit further.",1,2,26,8,9,3,7,3,10,2,1,0,8,4,1,0,57,43,89,83,557,370,493,307,104,105,41,35,6,7,2,10,7,41,2,2,0,0,0,0,14,16,Mazic Milorad,SRB,partly cloudy night,20,9,60

That moment came for Sweden tonight. Robin Olsen and Victor Lindelof had impressive performances but it wasn't enough. Mikael Lustig's absence was notable in the Swedish defence that, for the first time at this World Cup, had troubles in the air. When the disappointment has run its course, these players will look back on this World Cup with pride.","This was England's most complete performance of Russia 2018 in what was a highly-credible team effort. Three outstanding saves from Jordan Pickford awarded them with their first clean sheet of the tournament. Raheem Sterling may come under criticism for freezing in front of goal twice in as many minutes, but his driving runs and pace were key to sustaining the pressure on Sweden's backline.

Having emerged victorious on penalties after a gruelling encounter, the Balkan side have also got a monkey off their back by ending their hoodoo against World Cup hosts, having been knocked out by France in 1998 and lost to Brazil in the Opening Match of the 2014 edition.Roared on by a boisterous crowd at the Fisht Stadium, the Russians sought to press high up the pitch early on. Yet despite this pressure and the din, which rose to deafening levels every time the hosts sprang forward on the break, the Croats refused to be cowed, continuing to play their game and giving as good as they got.It was from one such counter-attack that Russia took the lead, Denis Cheryshev unleashing a left-footed piledriver that flew into the top corner. However, the Vatreni were not about to lie down and hit back a few minutes later, Andrej Kramaric stooping to head past Igor Akinfeev and ensuring the home fans' celebrations were short-lived.Besides an Ivan Perisic strike that clattered Akinfeev's post, clear-cut chances were few and far between in the second half, which was as tense as it was bereft of goalscoring action. Domagoj Vida headed home in the first period of extra time to silence the Russian supporters again, only for fans up and down the country to erupt with joy when Mario Fernandes equalised with just minutes remaining. Fernandes would go from hero to villain in the shoot-out though, his miss proving decisive as Stanislav Cherchesov's charges ultimately bowed out.","Russia came a cropper against their strongest opponents at the competition. The first half was relatively evenly matched, with chances and a goal at both ends. The Croats gained the ascendancy in the second half, but Russia displayed their spirit once again to hold firm and force extra time, like in the previous round. Unfortunately, on this occasion they did not keep their cool from the spot.","Croatia are through to the last four! It wasn't their most breathtaking performance in Russia, but the result is what counts and the Vatreni came away with another massive victory. Zlatko Dalic's men maintained their composure, dominated possession and continued to attack, and their perseverance was rewarded with the win - albeit not without some suspense.

After Raphael Varane performed heroics in the quarter-finals against Uruguay, this time it was Umtiti, stealing a march on his marker Marouane Fellaini to meet Antoine Griezmann's corner at the near post and flick a header beyond Thibaut Courtois.Once ahead, France locked down, robbing the Red Devils' star names of space to pick through in the final third, grinding down the clock - while looking to strike on the counter - until their place in the Moscow finale was confirmed.","France continue their brilliant showing as they avoided falling into Belgium's trap. After the Red Devils had dominated the first half, largely thanks to an awesome Eden Hazard, France took responsibility and controlled the match in the second. Didier Deschamps' team has many faces to it, but they are all smiling now.","Having a collection of great players individually does not guarantee anything. France and Belgium both have those resources but the former clearly managed get the most out of them in a collective fashion. When the goalkeepers are having a good day, the defence is organised and the rest of the players are very focused, the difference is often just a few small moments.

Less than five minutes were on the clock when Kieran Trippier curled a delicious free-kick past the helpless Danijel Subasic.Croatia struck back after the break. After continually increasing the pressure on the Three Lions, Sime Vrsaljko's pinpoint cross was met by Ivan Perisic, who snuck in to level from close range. Less than five minutes later, Perisic found himself in space in the English penalty area, but his effort struck the post, and the follow-up was gratefully held by Jordan Pickford.The Inter Milan man's effort off the woodwork was the closest either side came to taking the lead before the 90 minutes were up, meaning England faced a second period of extra time at Russia 2018 - with Croatia undertaking a third consecutive additional 30 minutes.Vatreni did not need penalties this time though. Mandzukic ghosted in behind the English defence, who momentarily lost concentration, and the Juventus man hammered home a historic strike to send his country into their maiden World Cup Final.","Croatia keep dreaming! Vatreni showed themselves and the world what they are capable of. They produced their best performance of the tournament right when they needed it most, showing their deep reserves of strength with another victory from a game that went to 120 minutes. Despite a quick England goal just five minutes from the start, Zlatko Dalic's side turned it around. France, are you ready?","England's unforgettable run at Russia 2018 has come to a heartbreaking end but was underlined by Croatia's ability to smother their primary strengths. The forwards hadn't the space they have been used to, the wing-backs had retreated and in midfield, battles were physical and play restricted. While Trippier's early goal left their position in the game favourable, Croatia's equaliser was a sucker-punch and as the Three Lions dropped their heads, Croatia started to believe.

Early pressure quickly turned into an early goal, with Meunier nipping in behind Danny Rose to tuck Nacer Chadli's cross past Jordan Pickford. Dominant and lively, they looked set to extend that lead until England regained their composure, dulling the incisive swipes of the Belgians' passing as the half wore on.Gareth Southgate's side gritted their teeth and began to dominate possession either side of half-time, probing for openings in the final third. While these were not plentiful, they looked the more likely to score, though the spectre of a Belgian counter loomed throughout.Eric Dier saw his cute, dinked effort hooked off the line by Toby Alderweireld in their best opportunity of the day, with Hazard sealing bronze on the break. Kevin De Bruyne slipped him in superbly and the final result was never in doubt as the Belgium captain tucked away assuredly.",Belgium did not have to push too hard to make the difference thanks to an early goal and some collective discipline. Their stars had their moments but they failed to take full advantage of the spaces left by the Three Lions. Belgium displayed a strong will to finish third for the first time in their history and their desire was rewarded with a prestigious second win in two matches over England in Russia.,"Ultimately, as with the semi-final defeat by Croatia, England's need to score more goals from open play re-surfaced. The Three Lions battled to create chances and the half-time introductions for Marcus Rashford and Jesse Lingard injected a greater threat going forward, yet near-misses from Harry Maguire, Harry Kane and Eric Dier will be rued.

Antoine Griezmann's lofted free kick from the French right was nodded into his own net by Mario Mandzukic.Ivan Perisic levelled with a calm effort from the edge of the penalty area, but he would turn from hero to villain. A cross from the French right-hand side was handled by the Croatia No4, with a penalty awarded after a VAR review.After the interval, France increased their lead through Paul Pogba, whose performances in the tournament deserved a goal in its finale. After Kylian Mbappe stretched the Croatian defence, Griezmann teed up Pogba, who finished after seeing his initial effort blocked.After his tireless running tired the Croatian defence, it was only fitting that Mbappe himself got on the scoresheet, hitting a sweetly-struck effort from the edge of the penalty area with which Danijel Subasic stood no chance.Mandzukic then scored in the same net, but this time to Croatia's advantage, capitalising on some carelessness by Hugo Lloris to reduce the deficit.In the end, the big No17's strike was not enough to spark yet another miraculous Croatian comeback, and Les Bleus emulate their heroes of 1998 - including coach Didier Deschamps - in securing their second World Cup title.","Tonight, the Croatian team played better football, but France were more efficient, perhaps even more intelligent. Les Bleus' strength is exactly this: no matter who they faced, they found the solution to beat their adversaries, one by one. Without being brilliant today, they scored four goals, which gives an idea about France's level, and their coach's one. Today, with his smart tactical set-up, Didier Deschamps won the duel with Dalic.","Croatia's dreams are now over. They were enjoying plenty of possession but struggled to convert that into anything of concern for Hugo Lloris.
